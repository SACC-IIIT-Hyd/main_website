Solid voice of reason (and apparently humorous too, which unfortunately was beyond my level. Only Arnav could get that).\nI am sooo glad you joined us for AoT. It was the best addition possible to the group. Thank you for always being there to help me out!\nI wish you all the very best in life. Hope we meet again!",

I’ve also learnt how precious good friendships are and that keeping in touch matters. So yeah, less fear, more fun, and maybe just a tiny bit more drama!!💃"

I picked up a few bad habits but overcame struggles I once thought I’d never move past. I’m less anxious, more grounded, and have truly lived the college experience. The ups and downs were real, but I made the most of it. With one year left, I hope to learn even more, grow further, and walk out proud, knowing I gave it my all."

While we haven't had prolonged interactions that often, from the few times we did talk about work, friends and life, I can say you're also a great conversationalist. You'll also be one of the first people I'll contact to learn about amazing places for dining and treats, so stay in touch!\n\nWishing you the best in all your future endeavours!",

I don't make friends that easily, and that humour, that charm - vo thoda kam ho gaya hai. But I guess that's part of growing up too."
